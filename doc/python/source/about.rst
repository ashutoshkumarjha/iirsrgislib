About
===============

The Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems software Library (RSGISLib) was started by Pete Bunting, whilst he was a lecturer within the Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences (IGES) at Aberystwyth University (Wales, UK) in April 2008 as a means of grouping together code developed as part of his research and to provide a better platform for development of new functions.

Dan Clewley joined the project in December 2008, shortly after starting his PhD within IGES, at Aberystwyth University (funded by a NERC studentship).

Features were added to RSGISLib, as required by Pete and Dan or requested by other researches and students within Aberystwyth University and the number of available functions grew rapidly.

The project was released under an open source licence and added to SourceForge in November 2009 in the hope it would be useful to others working in remote sensing and GIS.

The project continues to be actively developed, with new features added reguarly.
