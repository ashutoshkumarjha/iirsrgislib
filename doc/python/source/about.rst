About
===============

The Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems software Library (RSGISLib) was started by `Pete Bunting <http://users.aber.ac.uk/pfb/>`_, a lecturer in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences (DGES) at Aberystwyth University (Wales, UK) in April 2008 as a means of grouping together code developed as part of his research and to provide a better platform for development of new functions.

`Dan Clewley <http://mixil.usc.edu/people/staff/daniel-clewley.htm>`_ joined the project in December 2008, shortly after starting his PhD within DGES, at Aberystwyth University (funded by a NERC studentship).

Features were added to RSGISLib, as required by Pete and Dan or requested by other researches and students within Aberystwyth University and collaborators in other institutions. 

The project was released under the GPL license in November 2009 in the hope it would be useful to others working in remote sensing and GIS and has been actively developed since then. Currently there are over 300 commands to perform a number of tasks.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**What does RSGISLib do?**

RSGISLib contains a number of algorithms for processing and analysing remote sensing data that are the product of research carried out by the authors and their collaborators. The primary aim of RSGISLib was to make it easier to develop code for our research. Over time, more functionality has been added to make it easier to carry out our research. The project was released with the hope it will be of use to others working with Remote Sensing and GIS data. To date it's been used as part of a number of publications and theses.

**Is RSGISLib intended to be a substitute for commercial GIS / RS packages or other open source packages?**

No, RSGISLib is not being developed as a substitute for ArcMap / QGIS or ENVI. As stated above, RSGISLib is mainly developed to support our research, because of this there is a lot of advanced functionality in RSGISLib that is unavailable in other packages. 

For visualising data it is recommended RSGISLib is used in combination with TuiView, an open source cross-platform viewer available to download from `here <https://bitbucket.org/chchrsc/tuiview>`_.

**Is this free software?**

Yes, this software is provided freely under a GPL3 license. The software is free to use and the source code is available to look at and modify.

**Where can I get help with RSGISLib?**

The manual is available to download from `here <https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/rsgislib-documentation/>`_.

Help is provided via our mailing list.

**How do I go about getting functionality added to RSGISLib?**

For general suggestions submit a ticket on our `issues <https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/rsgislib/issues?status=new&status=open>`_ page on Bitbucket or post a suggestion on the mailing list. If there's functionality you need adding for a specific project you could try to add it yourself or you can contact us to enquire about consultancy work. 

**How do I cite RSGISLib**

If you have used RSGISLib for published work then you should cite the following publication, and / or the specific paper of the algorithm you used (if applicable).
