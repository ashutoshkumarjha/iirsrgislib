Documentation & Tutorials
==========================

A PDF containing the general documentation for RSGISLib, which provides information on installation and the XML interface is available to download from Bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/rsgislib-documentation/.

The documentation is written in LaTeX and is stored as a mercurial repository. If you'd like to add to the documentation (and this would be really appreciated), or have any corrections just create a pull request or email them.

The documentation for the Python bindings is available through this website or the standard Python help system. The main site contains documentation for the latest development version of RSGISLib. Documentation for older versions is available at:

* `2.1 <https://rsgislib.org/2.1>`_ 

We have also produced a set of Python notes `Python Tutorial for Spatial Data Processing <https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/python-tutorial-for-spatial-data-processing/>`_ used as part of the MSc course in Remote Sensing and GIS at Aberystwyth University.
