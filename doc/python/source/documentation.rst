Documentation & Tutorials
==========================

Documentation for the Python bindings are available through this website or the standard Python help system. The main site contains documentation for the latest development version of RSGISLib (default branch). Documentation is also available for previous releases:

* `2.1 <http://rsgislib.org/2_1/>`_ 

A PDF containing the general documentation for RSGISLib, which provides information on installation and the XML interface is available to download from Bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/rsgislib-documentation/.

We have also produced a set of Python notes `Python Tutorial for Spatial Data Processing <https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/python-tutorial-for-spatial-data-processing/>`_ used as part of the MSc course in Remote Sensing and GIS at Aberystwyth University.
