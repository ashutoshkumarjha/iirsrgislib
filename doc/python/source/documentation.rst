Documentation & Tutorials
==========================

A PDF containing the general documentation for RSGISLib, which provides information on installation and the XML interface is available to download from Bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/rsgislib-documentation/.

The documentation is written in LaTeX and is stored as a mercurial repository. If you'd like to add to the documentation (and this would be really appreciated), or have any corrections just create a pull request or email them.

The documentation for the Python bindings is available through this website or the standard Python help system.

We have also produced a set of Python notes `Python Tutorial for Spatial Data Processing <https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/python-tutorial-for-spatial-data-processing/>`_ used as part of the MSc course in Remote Sensing and GIS at Aberystwyth University.
